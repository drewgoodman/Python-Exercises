# keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:
# Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
# Albert Einstein
# Benjamin Franklin
# Ada Lovelace
# >> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
# Benjamin Franklin
# >> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.

    'Benjamin Franklin' : (1, 17, 1706),
    'Ada Lovelace' : (12, 10, 1815)
}

print("Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:")
